# Creating a social website project

We will create a social application that will allow users to share images they find on the internet. We will need to build the following elements for this project:
- An authentication system for users to register, login, edit their profile, and change or reset their password
- A followers' system to allow users to follow each other
- A functionality to display shared images and implement a bookmarklet for users to share images from any website
- An activity stream for each user that allows users to see the content uploaded by the people they follow

This chapter addresses the first point mentioned in the preceding list.

## Starting your social website project
```
mkdir bookmarks && cd bookmarks
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install django

django-admin startproject bookmarks .
```

```
(.venv) bookmarks> tree
.
├── bookmarks
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
└── manage.py
```

```
django-admin startapp account
```
`settings.py`:
```py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'account.apps.AccountConfig',
]

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        # 'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        # 'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'django_bookmarks',
        'USER': 'django',
        'PASSWORD': '123456',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '54321',
    }
}
```

```
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

```
python manage.py migrate
```

# Using the Django authentication framework
When you create a new Django project using the `startproject` command, the authentication framework is included in the default settings of your project. It consists of the `django.contrib.auth` application and the following two middleware classes found in the `MIDDLEWARE` setting of your project:
- `AuthenticationMiddleware`: Associates users with requests using sessions
- `SessionMiddleware`: Handles the current session across requests

The authentication framework also includes the following models:
- `User`: A user model with basic fields; the main fields of this model are `username` , `password` , `email` , `first_name` , `last_name` , and  `is_active`
- `Group`: A group model to categorize users
- `Permission`: Flags for users or groups to perform certain actions

## Creating a login view
Our view should perform the following actions to log in a user:
- Get the username and password by posting a form
- Authenticate the user against the data stored in the database
- Check whether the user is active
- Log the user into the website and start an authenticated session

`account/forms.py`:
```python
from django import forms


class LoginForm(forms.Form):
    username = forms.CharField()
    password = forms.CharField(widget=forms.PasswordInput)
```

`account/views.py`:
```python
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.shortcuts import render

from .forms import LoginForm


def user_login(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = LoginForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            cd = form.cleaned_data
            user = authenticate(request,
                                username=cd['username'],
                                password=cd['password'])
            if user is not None:
                if user.is_active:
                    login(request, user)
                    return HttpResponse('Authenticated successfully')
                else:
                    return HttpResponse('Disabled account')
            else:
                return HttpResponse('Invalid login')
    else:
        form = LoginForm()
    return render(request, 'account/login.html', {'form': form})
```

`account/urls.py`:
```python
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('login/', views.user_login, name='login'),
]
```
`bookmarks/urls.py`:
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('account/', include('account.urls')),
]
```
Create the following files and directories inside the `account` application directory:
```
(.venv) bookmarks> tree account/templates
account/templates
├── account
│   └── login.html
└── base.html
```
```
mkdir -p static/css
touch static/css/base.css
```
`base.html`:
```html
{% load staticfiles %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>{% block title %}{% endblock %}</title>
    <link href="{% static "css/base.css" %}" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="header">
        <span class="logo">Bookmarks</span>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
        {% block content %}
        {% endblock %}
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```
`account/login.html`:
```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block title %}Log-in{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<h1>Log-in</h1>
<p>Please, use the following form to log-in:</p>
    <form action="." method="post">
      {{ form.as_p }}
      {% csrf_token %}
      <p><input type="submit" value="Log in"></p>
    </form>
{% endblock %}
```

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Using Django authentication views

Django provides the following class-based views to deal with authentication. All of them are located in `django.contrib.auth.views`:
- `LoginView`: Handles a login form and logs in a user
- `LogoutView`: Logs out a user

Django provides the following views to handle password changes:
- `PasswordChangeView`: Handles a form to change the user password
- `PasswordChangeDoneView`: The success view the user is redirected to after a successful password change

Django also includes the following views to allow users to reset their password:
- `PasswordResetView`: Allows users to reset their password. It generates a one-time use link with a token and sends it to the user's email account.
- `PasswordResetDoneView`: Tells users that an email—including a link to reset their password—has been sent to them.
- `PasswordResetConfirmView`: Allows users to set a new password.
- `PasswordResetCompleteView`: The success view the user is redirected to after successfully resetting the password.

You can get more information about the built-in authentication views at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/auth/default/#all-authentication-views .

## Login and logout views
Edit the `urls.py` of your account application, like this:
```python
from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    # path('login/', views.user_login, name='login'),
    path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(), name='login'),
    path('logout/', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(), name='logout'),
]
```
`templates/registration/login.html`:
```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block title %}Log-in{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>Log-in</h1>
    {% if form.errors %}
        <p>
        Your username and password didn't match.
        Please try again.
        </p>
    {% else %}
        <p>Please, use the following form to log-in:</p>
    {% endif %}

    <div class="login-form">
        <form action="{% url 'login' %}" method="post">
            {{ form.as_p }}
            {% csrf_token %}
            <input type="hidden" name="next" value="{{ next }}">
            <p><input type="submit" value="Log-in"></p>
        </form>
    </div>

{% endblock %}
```
`templates/registration/logged_out.html`:
````html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block title %}
Logged out
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<h1>Logged out</h1>
    <p>You have been successfully logged out. You can <a href="{% url 'login' %}">log-in again</a>.</p>
{% endblock %}
````

After adding the URL patterns and the templates for login and logout views, your website is ready for users to log in using Django authentication views.

Now, we will create a new view to display a dashboard when users log in to their account. Open the `views.py` file of your `account` application and add the following code to it:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required

@login_required
def dashboard(request):
    return render(request, 'account/dashboard.html', {'section': 'dashboard'})
```

`templates/account/dashboard.html`:
```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block title %}
Dashboard
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>Dashboard</h1>
    <p>Welcome to your dashboard.</p>
{% endblock %}
```

`account/urls.py`:
```python
from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    # path('login/', views.user_login, name='login'),
    path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(), name='login'),
    path('logout/', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(), name='logout'),
    path('', views.dashboard, name='dashboard'),
]
```

`settings.py`:
```python
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = 'dashboard'
LOGIN_URL = 'login'
LOGOUT_URL = 'logout'
```

`templates/base.html`:
```html
    <div id="header">
        <span class="logo">Bookmarks</span>
        {% if request.user.is_authenticated %}
            <ul class="menu">
                <li {% if section == 'dashboard' %}class="selected"{% endif %}><a href="{% url 'dashboard' %}">My dashboard</a></li>
                <li {% if section == 'images' %}class="selected"{% endif %}><a href="#">Images</a></li>
                <li {% if section == 'people' %}class="selected"{% endif %}><a href="#">People</a></li>
            </ul>
            {% endif %}

            <span class="user">
                {% if request.user.is_authenticated %}
                Hello {{ request.user.first_name }},{{ request.user.username }},<a href="{% url 'logout' %}">Logout</a>
                    {% else %}
                    <a href="{% url 'login' %}">Log-in</a>
                {% endif %}
            </span>
    </div>
```

## Changing password views
`account/urls.py`:
```python
# ...

urlpatterns = [

    # ...

    path('password_change/',
         auth_views.PasswordChangeView.as_view(),
         name='password_change'),
    path('password_change/done/',
         auth_views.PasswordChangeDoneView.as_view(),
         name='password_change_done'),
]
```


`templates/registration/password_change_form.html`:
```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block title %}Change your password{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>Change your password</h1>
    <p>Use the form below to change your password.</p>
    <form action="." method="post">
        {{ form.as_p }}
        <p><input type="submit" value="Change"></p>
        {% csrf_token %}
    </form>
{% endblock %}
```


`templates/registration/password_change_done.html`:
```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block title %}Password changed{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>Password changed</h1>
    <p>Your password has been successfully changed.</p>
{% endblock %}
```

## Resetting password views
Add the following URL patterns for password restoration to the `urls.py` file of the `account` application:
```python
from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    
    # ...

    path('password_reset/',
         auth_views.PasswordResetView.as_view(),
         name='password_reset'),
    path('password_reset/done/',
         auth_views.PasswordResetDoneView.as_view(),
         name='password_reset_done'),
    path('reset/<uidb64>/<token>/',
         auth_views.PasswordResetConfirmView.as_view(),
         name='password_reset_confirm'),
    path('reset/done/',
         auth_views.PasswordResetCompleteView.as_view(),
         name='password_reset_complete'),
]
```

`password_reset_form.html`:

```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block title %}
Reset your password
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<h1>Forgotten your password?</h1>
    <p>Enter your e-mail address to obtain a new password.</p>
    <form action="." method="post" novalidate>
        {{ form.as_p }}
        {% csrf_token %}
        <p><input type="submit" value="Send e-mail"></p>
    </form>
{% endblock %}
```

`password_reset_email.html`:
```html
Someone asked for password reset for email {{ email }}. Follow the link below:
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url "password_reset_confirm" uidb64=uid token=token %}
Your username, in case you've forgotten: {{ user.get_username }}
```

`password_reset_done.html`:
```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block title %}
    Reset your password
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>Reset your password</h1>
    <p>We've emailed you instructions for setting your password.</p>
    <p>If you don't receive an email, please make sure you've entered the
        address you registered with.</p>
{% endblock %}
```

`password_reset_confirm.html`:
```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block title %}Reset your password{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>Reset your password</h1>
    {% if validlink %}
        <p>Please enter your new password twice:</p>
        <form action="." method="post">
            {{ form.as_p }}
            {% csrf_token %}
            <p><input type="submit" value="Change my password"/></p>
        </form>
    {% else %}
        <p>The password reset link was invalid, possibly because it has
            already been used. Please request a new password reset.</p>
    {% endif %}
{% endblock %}
```

We check whether the provided link is valid. The view `PasswordResetConfirmView` sets this variable and puts it in the context of the `password_reset_confirm.html` template. If the link is valid, we display the user password reset form.

`password_reset_complete.html`:
```html
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block title %}Password reset{% endblock %}
{% block content %}
    <h1>Password set</h1>
    <p>Your password has been set. You can <a href="{% url "login" %}">log in now</a></p>
{% endblock %}
```

`registration/login.html`:
```html
<p><a href="{% url 'password_reset' %}">Forgotten your password?</a></p>
```

At this point, you need to add an SMTP configuration to the `settings.py` file of your project so that Django is able to send emails. You learned how to add email settings to your project in [Chapter 2](https://github.com/keer2345/django-learning/blob/master/django-2-by-example/ch02.md#sending-emails-with-django) , Enhancing Your Blog with Advanced Features.

However, during development, you can configure Django to write emails to the standard output instead of sending them through an SMTP server. Django provides an email backend to write emails to the console. Edit the `settings.py` file of your project, and add the following line:
```
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
```

The `EMAIL_BACKEND` setting indicates the class to use to send emails.

Take a look at the console where you are running the development server. You will see the generated email, as follows:
```
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Subject: Password reset on 127.0.0.1:8000
From: webmaster@localhost
To: user@domain.com
Date: Fri, 15 Dec 2017 14:35:08 -0000
Message-ID: <20150924143508.62996.55653@zenx.local>
Someone asked for password reset for email user@domain.com. Follow the link
below:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/account/reset/MQ/45f-9c3f30caafd523055fcc/
Your username, in case you've forgotten: zenx
```

Django also provides the authentication URL patterns we just created. You can comment out the authentication URL patterns we added to the `urls.py` file of the `account` application and include `django.contrib.auth.urls` instead, as follows:
```python
from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views
from django.urls import include, path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    # path('login/', views.user_login, name='login'),
    path('', views.dashboard, name='dashboard'),

    # path('login/', auth_views.LoginView.as_view(), name='login'),
    # path('logout/', auth_views.LogoutView.as_view(), name='logout'),
    # path('password_change/',
    #      auth_views.PasswordChangeView.as_view(),
    #      name='password_change'),
    # path('password_change/done/',
    #      auth_views.PasswordChangeDoneView.as_view(),
    #      name='password_change_done'),
    # path('password_reset/',
    #      auth_views.PasswordResetView.as_view(),
    #      name='password_reset'),
    # path('password_reset/done/',
    #      auth_views.PasswordResetDoneView.as_view(),
    #      name='password_reset_done'),
    # path('reset/<uidb64>/<token>/',
    #      auth_views.PasswordResetConfirmView.as_view(),
    #      name='password_reset_confirm'),
    # path('reset/done/',
    #      auth_views.PasswordResetCompleteView.as_view(),
    #      name='password_reset_complete'),

    # alternative way to include authentication views
    path('', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
]
```

You can see the authentication URL patterns included at https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/2.0.x/django/contrib/auth/urls.py .

# User registration and user profiles
## User registration
`account/forms.py`:
```python
from django import forms
from django.contrib.auth.models import User


class LoginForm(forms.Form):
    # ...


class UserRegistration(forms.ModelForm):
    password = forms.CharField(label='Password', widget=forms.PasswordInput)
    password2 = forms.CharField(label='Repeat password',
                                widget=forms.PasswordInput)

    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ('username', 'first_name', 'email')

    def clean_password2(self):
        cd = self.cleaned_data
        if cd['password'] != cd['password2']:
            raise forms.ValidationError('Passwords dont\'t match')
        return cd['password2']
```
Django also provides a UserCreationForm form that you can use, which resides in django.contrib.auth.forms and is very similar to the one we have created.

Edit the `views.py` file of the `account` application and add the following code to it:
```python
# ...

from .forms import LoginForm, UserRegistration

def user_login(request):
    # ...

@login_required
def dashboard(request):
    # ...

def register(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        user_form = UserRegistration(request.POST)
        if user_form.is_valid():
            # Create a new user object but aviod saving it yet
            new_user = user_form.save(commit=False)
            # Set the choosen password
            new_user.set_password(user_form.cleaned_data['password'])
            # Save the user
            new_user.save()
            return render(request, 'account/register_done.html',
                          {'new_user': new_user})
    else:
        user_form = UserRegistration()
    return render(request, 'account/register.html', {'user_form': user_form})
```

`account/urls.py`:
```python
path('register/', views.register, name='register'),
```

`account/register.html`:
```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block title %}
Create an account
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<h1>Create an account</h1>
    <p>Please, sign up using the following form：</p>
    <form action="." method="post" novalidate>
    {{ user_form.as_p }}
    {% csrf_token %}
    <p><input type="submit" value="Register"></p>
    </form>
{% endblock %}
```
`account/register_done.html`:
```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block title %}
Welcome
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>Welcome {{ new_user.first_name }}!</h1>
    <p>Your account has been successfully created. Now you can <a href="{% url 'login' %}">log in</a>.</p>
{% endblock %}
```
Now, you can also add a link to registration in your login template. Edit the `registration/login.html` template; take a look at the following line:
```html
<p>Please, use the following form to log-in:</p>
```
Replace it with the following:
```html
<p>Please, use the following form to log-in. If you don't have an account 
  <a href="{% url "register" %}">register here</a></p>
```
We made the signup page accessible from the login page.

Now, open http://127.0.0.1:8000/account/register/ in your browser. You will see the registration page you have created.

## Extending the user model
When you have to deal with user accounts, you will find that the user model of the Django authentication framework is suitable for common cases. However, the user model comes with very basic fields. You may wish to extend the user model to include additional data. The best way to do this is by creating a profile model that contains all additional fields and a one-to-one relationship with the Django user model.

Edit the `models.py` file of your `account` application and add the following code to it:
```python
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models


class Profile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
                                on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    date_of_birth = models.DateField(blank=True, null=True)
    photo = models.ImageField(upload_to='user/%Y/%m/%d/', blank=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return "Profile for user {}".format(self.user.username)
```

- The `user` one-to-one field allows you to associate profiles with users. We use `CASCADE` for the `on_delete` parameter so that its related profile also gets deleted when a user is deleted.
- The `photo` field is an `ImageField` field. You will need to install the `Pillow` library to handle images. Install `Pillow` by running the following command in your shell:

```
pip install pillow
```

For Django to serve media files uploaded by users with the development server, add the following settings to the `settings.py` file of your project:
```
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media/')
```

`MEDIA_URL` is the base URL to serve the media files uploaded by users, and `MEDIA_ROOT` is the local path where they reside. We build the path dynamically relative to our project path to make our code more generic.


Now, edit the main `urls.py` file of the `bookmarks` project and modify the code, as follows:
```python
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('account/', include('account.urls')),
]

if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL,
                          document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
```

In this way, the Django development server will be in charge of serving the media files during development (that is when the `DEBUG` setting is set to `True` ).

> The `static()` helper function is suitable for development, but not for production use. Never serve your static files with Django in a production environment.

Open the shell and run the following command to create thedatabase migration for the new model:
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Edit the `admin.py` file of the `account` application and register the `Profile` model in the administration site, like this:
```python
from django.contrib import admin

from .models import Profile


@admin.register(Profile)
class ProfileAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ['user', 'date_of_birth', 'photo']
```

Now, we will let users edit their profile on the website. Add the following import and model forms to the `forms.py` file of the `account` application:
```python
from .models import Profile

class UserEditForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ('first_name', 'last_name', 'email')

class ProfileEditForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Profile
        fields = ('date_of_birth', 'photo')
```

Edit the `views.py` file of the `account` application and import the Profile model, like this:
```python
from .models import Profile
```
Then, add the following lines to the `register` view below `new_user.save()` :
```python
# Create the user profile
Profile.objects.create(user=new_user)
```

`account/views.py`:
```python
from .forms import LoginForm, ProfileEditForm, UserEditForm, UserRegistration

# ...

@login_required
def edit(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        user_form = UserEditForm(instance=request.user, data=request.POST)
        profile_form = ProfileEditForm(instance=request.user.profile,
                                       data=request.POST,
                                       files=request.FILES)
        if user_form.is_valid() and profile_form.is_valid():
            user_form.save()
            profile_form.save()
    else:
        user_form = UserEditForm(instance=request.user)
        profile_form = ProfileEditForm(instance=request.user.profile)

    return render(request, 'account/edit.html', {
        'user_form': user_form,
        'profile_form': profile_form
    })
```

`account/urls.py`:
```python
path('edit/', views.edit, name='edit'),
```

`templates/account/edit.html`:
```html
{#edit.html#}
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block title %}
Edit your account
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<h1>Edit your account</h1>
    <p>You can edit your account using the following form:</p>
    <form action="." method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" novalidate>
    {{ user_form.as_p }}
    {{ profile_form.as_p }}
    {% csrf_token %}
        <p><input type="submit" value="Save changes"></p>
    </form>
{% endblock %}
```

Now, you can also edit the dashboard page and include links to the edit profile and change password pages. Open the `account/dashboard.html` template:
```
<p>Welcome to your dashboard.</p>
```
Replace the preceding line with the following one:
```
<p>Welcome to your dashboard. You can <a href="{% url "edit" %}">edit your
profile</a> or <a href="{% url "password_change" %}">change your
password</a>.</p>
```

### Using a custom user model
Django also offers a way to substitute the whole user model with your own custom model. Your user class should inherit from Django's `AbstractUser` class, which provides the full implementation of the default user as an abstract model. You can read more about this method at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/auth/customizing/#substituting-a-custom-user-model .

Using a custom user model will give you more flexibility, but it might also result in more difficult integration with pluggable applications that interact with Django's auth user model.

## Using the messages framework
The messages framework is located at `django.contrib.messages` and is included in the default `INSTALLED_APPS` list of the `settings.py` file when you create new projects using `python manage.py startproject` . You will note that your settings file contains a middleware named `django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware` in the `MIDDLEWARE` settings.

The messages framework provides a simple way to add messages to users. Messages are stored in a cookie by default (falling back to session storage), and they are displayed in the next request the user does. You can use the messages framework in your views by importing the `messages` module and adding new messages with simple shortcuts, as follows:
```python
from django.contrib import messages
messages.error(request, 'Something went wrong')
```

You can create new messages using the `add_message()` method or any of the following shortcut methods:
- `success()`: Success messages to be displayed after an action was successful
- `info()`: Informational messages
- `warning()`: Something has not yet failed but may fail imminently
- `error()`: An action was not successful, or something failed
- `debug()`: Debug messages that will be removed or ignored in a production environment

Open the `base.html` template of the `account` application and add the following code between the `<div>` element with the `header` ID and the `<div>` element with the `content` ID:
```html
{% load staticfiles %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <!-- ... -->
</head>
<body>
    <div id="header">

        <!-- ... -->

    </div>

    {% if messages %}
    <ul class="messages">
        {% for message in messages %}
            <li class="{{ message.tags }}">{{ message|safe }}<a href="#" class="close">X</a></li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endif %}

    <div id="content">

        <!-- ... -->

    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Now, let's modify our edit view to use the messages framework. Edit the `views.py` file of the `account` application, import `messages` , and make the edit view look as follows:
```python
from django.contrib import messages


@login_required
def edit(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        user_form = UserEditForm(instance=request.user, data=request.POST)
        profile_form = ProfileEditForm(instance=request.user.profile,
                                       data=request.POST,
                                       files=request.FILES)
        if user_form.is_valid() and profile_form.is_valid():
            user_form.save()
            profile_form.save()
            messages.success(request, 'Profile updated successfully')
        else:
            messages.error(request, 'Error updating your profile')
    else:
        user_form = UserEditForm(instance=request.user)
        profile_form = ProfileEditForm(instance=request.user.profile)

    return render(request, 'account/edit.html', {
        'user_form': user_form,
        'profile_form': profile_form
    })
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/account/edit/ in your browser and edit your profile. When the profile is successfully updated, you should see the following message.

You can learn more about the messages framework at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/contrib/messages/ .

# Building a custom authentication backend
The default `ModelBackend` authenticates users against the database using the user model of `django.contrib.auth` . This will suit most of your projects. However, you can create custom backends to authenticate your user against other sources, such as an LDAP directory or any other system.

You can read more information about customizing authentication at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/auth/customizing/#other-authentication-sources .

Django provides a simple way to define your own authentication backends. An authentication backend is a class that provides the following two methods:
- `authenticate()`
- `get_user()`

Creating a custom authentication backend is as simple as writing a Python class that implements both methods. We will create an authentication backend to let users authenticate in our site using their email address instead of their username.

Create a new file inside your `account` application directory and name it `authentication.py` . Add the following code to it:
```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User


class EmailAuthBackend(object):
    """
    Authenticate using an e-mail address.
    """
    def authenticate(self, request, username=None, password=None):
        try:
            user = User.objects.get(email=username)
            if user.check_password(password):
                return user
            return None
        except User.DoesNotExist:
            return None

    def get_user(self, user_id):
        try:
            return User.objects.get(pk=user_id)
        except User.DoesNotExist:
            return None
```

`setting.py`:
```python
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
    'account.authentication.EmailAuthBackend',
]
```

# Adding social authentication to your site

You might also want to add social authentication to your site using services such as Facebook, Twitter, or Google. Python Social Auth is a Python module that simplifies the process of adding social authentication to our website. Using this module, you can let your users log in to your website using their account of other services. You can find the code of this module at https://github.com/python-social-auth .
```
pip install social-auth-app-django
```
`settings.py`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    #...
    'social_django',
]
```
Run the following command to sync python-social-auth models with your database:
```
python manage.py migrate
```

Python-social-auth includes backends for multiple services. You can see a list of all backends at https://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/index.html#supported-backends .

`bookmarks/urls.py`:
```python
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('account/', include('account.urls')),
    path('social-auth/', include('social_django.urls', namespace='social')),
]
```
Several social services will not allow the redirecting of users to `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` after a successful authentication. In order to make social authentication work, you will need a domain. In order to fix this, under Linux or macOS X, edit your `/etc/hosts` file and add the following line to it:
```
127.0.0.1 mysite.com
```
If you are using Windows, your `hosts` file is located at `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts` .


`settings.py`:
```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['mysite.com', 'localhost', '127.0.0.1']
```

## Authentication using Facebook

## Authentication using Twitter

omit ...

## Authentication using Google

Google offers OAuth2 authentication. You can read about Google's OAuth2 implementation at https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2.

`settings.py`:
```python
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
    'account.authentication.EmailAuthBackend',
    'social_core.backends.facebook.FacebookOAuth2',
    'social_core.backends.twitter.TwitterOAuth',
    'social_core.backends.google.GoogleOAuth2',
]
```

First, you will need to create an API key in your Google Developer Console. Open https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials in your browser. Click on Select a project and create a new project.

After the project is created, under Credentials, click on Create credentials and choose OAuth client ID.

`settings.py`:
```python
SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_KEY = 'XXX' # Google Consumer Key
SOCIAL_AUTH_GOOGLE_OAUTH2_SECRET = 'XXX' # Google Consumer Secret
```

Edit the `login.html` template and add the following code to the `<ul>` element:
```html
<div class="social">
    <ul>
        <li class="google"><a href="{% url 'social:begin' 'google-oauth2' %}">Log in with Google</a></li>
    </ul>
</div>
```
